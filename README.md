# Sudoku-Solver
A sudoku solver

Author: Connor Seiden

This program is a sudoku solver that will take an incomplete sukdoku board and find the solution, if one exists.  It currently only runs through standard i/o and the command line, but I plan on implementing a GUI and a mobile version.

The program finds the solution to a sudoku board through the use of a modified backtracking algorithm.  It recursively searches through valid board configurations until a complete, valid board is found.

This program is written in Java 1.7

To run this program, the main method is in SudokuSolver.java
